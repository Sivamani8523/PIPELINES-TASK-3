To design, implement, and simulate a 4-stage pipelined processor in Verilog HDL that supports basic instructions such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD, demonstrating instruction-level parallelism and improved throughput.
Verilog HDL
ModelSim / Vivado / any other simulation tool (specify which)
Testbench to simulate instruction flow and stage behavior
Design Description:
The processor is built using a 4-stage pipeline architecture. Pipelining is a technique that allows overlapping of instruction execution stages, improving performance over a sequential design.
